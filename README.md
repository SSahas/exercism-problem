## Description

<span style="font-family:Century Gothic ; font-size:1.3em;"> Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies). 
    But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster.

## Description

<span style="font-family:Century Gothic ; font-size:1.3em;"> The code can be used to find the centroids of the clusters in the data. It requires 
 declaring some partial centroids at first  and also the data points which are iterable.
</span>






## Working 
- The code contains functions named move_centroid, assigh_centroid, Run.
- The partial centroids and the data should be passed through "Run" function and then it goes through different operations to find the centroid for some number of iterations.
